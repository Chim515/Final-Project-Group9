NLP Final Project - SGD for Text Classification

The data can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd?select=globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv

The code folder contains the code implemented. it also includes a read me file on how to run it. The presentation and report folders, contain my presentationa and report respectively. And the proposal folder contains my initial propose idea for the project.


The aim of this project was to optimize a logistic regression and SVM classification model using Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) learning algorithm and to show that these classification models could be further optimized using Gridsearch to tune the hyperparameters.
